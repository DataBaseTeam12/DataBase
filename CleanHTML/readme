So, this is what I've been doing for a few days.
In my opinion, I have a good layout going which is easy to follow.
It will allow each of our pages to look the same and function the same.

For now, don't worry about the footer.
It will require a little bit of javascript, which can be done later.
Also, making this work on mobile might be of interest.
But that too will require a bit of javascript and more css.

Now that the page look good, we can focus on the data.
